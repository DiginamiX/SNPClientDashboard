## 📋 Step-by-Step Connection Guide

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase API Keys
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vdykrlyybwwbcqqcgjbp
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
3. Copy the following values:

2. Find your **Database Password** (the one you set when creating the project)
3. If you forgot it, you can reset it from the same page

### Step 3: Create Environment Variables

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development

```

### Step 4: Create Client Environment File
Create `client/.env.local` with:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://vdykrlyybwwbcqqcgjbp.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY_FROM_DASHBOARD
```

### Step 5: Link Project and Deploy Schema
```bash
# Link to your project (use your actual DB password when prompted)
supabase link --project-ref vdykrlyybwwbcqqcgjbp

# Deploy our enhanced coaching schema to your project
supabase db push

# Generate TypeScript types from your remote database
supabase gen types typescript --remote > shared/supabase-types.ts
```

### Step 6: Test Connection
